# website-angularjs-prototype

This was an attempt to create a whole new website for EfG Ludwigshafen as a single-page application with (as of the time writing) not even a backend (and images from [lorempixel](lorempixel.com) instead of real images etc. pp.).

*The project is no longer continued.* See it as an inspiration for future AngularJS projects (or as a nostalgic approach of how people in 2014 created AngularJS apps).
